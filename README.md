🛡️ Secure Password Toolkit

A client-side, privacy-focused web application to check password strength and generate a secure, non-reversible SHA-256 hash. This tool operates entirely within your browser, ensuring that no sensitive password data is ever transmitted or stored on any server.

✨ Features

🚀 Real-time Strength Analysis: Get immediate feedback on your password's strength as you type.


📊 Visual Feedback: A dynamic strength bar and a clear checklist of criteria help you create stronger passwords.


🔒 Secure Hashing: Utilizes the browser's built-in Web Crypto API to generate a standard SHA-256 hash. The same password will always produce the same hash.



📋 One-Click Copy: Easily copy the generated hash to your clipboard.


👁️ Toggle Visibility: Show or hide your password for easier typing and verification.


📱 Responsive Design: A clean, modern "glassmorphism" interface that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.


🌍 100% Client-Side: All logic is executed in your browser. No password information ever leaves your local machine, guaranteeing user privacy.


🚀 Getting Started
